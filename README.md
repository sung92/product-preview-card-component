## Overview

One card component.

Used Sass for styling.

Implemented media queries for the first time in a FM's challenge.
Used BEM for class names and thought a good HTML structure first before styling it.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [CSS reset](https://github.com/mayank99/reset.css) - To baseline cross-browser styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- How to structure a good HTML first.
- Landmarks: header, main, aside and footer.
- Picture element for images
- Ribbon text, headings and hgroup element for wrapping headings for a more visual-friendly structure.
- <s> and <del> elements for a better accesibility.
- When to use <button> and <a> for buttons.
- Testing the final website with keyboard and screenreader for accesibility.

### Continued development

My main focus now is to create a well-structured HTML first. Also to keep implementing what I've learned for this project. Next step, I would like to use a better <button> and <a> classnames for styling the base first (.btn, .link), and then use a modifier for each specific button (btn--primary, btn--secondary, etc &&  link--primary, link--secondary, etc).

### Useful resources

- [BEM](https://getbem.com/introduction/)
- [Tweaking Text Level Styles](https://adrianroselli.com/2017/12/tweaking-text-level-styles.html) - For accesibility: <s>, <del>, <mark>, <ins>.
